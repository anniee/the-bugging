#The Bugging

Programmers spend enough time debugging. The Bugging is a playful exercise for the programmer (Anne Vetto) to practice and solidify her knowledge in OOP while creating colorful "bugs". The Bugging involves generating bugs with specific, inheritable attributes (e.g. wing/eye color, pattern, body detail, number of legs) and methods (e.g. movement, size growth). The project will eventually implement Mendelian genetics principles in algorithms to dictate inheritance of said bug qualities.

### Until server is set up, to see the bugging in action:

clone this repository and run in terminal:
    python bugging.py
